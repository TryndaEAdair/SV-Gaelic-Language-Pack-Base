# [CP] Gleann Dealtreul
This is a repository containing a basic structure for a Stardew Valley content pack to add custom language support for the Gaelic language. Only files containing updatable text will be included to reduce download sizes. Some text is built into the images and will require modification with a tool like Photoshop/GIMP, so some similar fonts have been included as a starting point to achieving this.



=== Included Assets & Resources ===
- Stardew Valley Styled Fonts
- GIMP Project Files for modified sprite images
- Microsoft Scottish Gaelic Style Guide. This is a guideline for UI (User Interface) development. 



=== Content Pack Requirements ===
SMAPI 2.6 or above installed and Content Patcher 1.4 mod or higher installed. 
*Note: Only when installing SMAPI will there be the Mods folder

SMAPI: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400?tab=files
Content Patcher: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915?tab=files



=== Current Development Points of Interest ===
Files will be updated as nessesary as new text is added to the base game and if any base strings are missed.

I'm still working on some minor things, like how to add a language to the list of languages properly, currently only strings can be changed out.


=== Easter Eggs ===
Pelican Town has been renamed to Selkirk (Salcraig), the town where the content pack creator grew up around.
